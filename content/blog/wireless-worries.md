1) Buy some wireless headphones. (Ask [/r/headphones](https://reddit.com/r/headphones) for help on choosing the best pair.)

2) Do not buy a phone without the jack. Vote with your wallet.

3) Only listen to music from remote speakers.

4) Beg Apple nicely that they put the jack back.

5) Beg Motorola to start including the jack again.

6) Oh, and Essential, too.

7) Google, too?! Are you kidding me?

8) Give Samsung as much money as possible for including a jack on their S8.

9) Use an adapter that came with your phone or buy one so you can charge & listen at the same time. This option is costly, but also practical. Surrendering is fun.

10) Cry because this is making you stressed and you just want to listen to [something](/blog/the-first-of-the-many/) without reading an overly complicated tech article.

Well, we can consider this problem solved!
