<h2>3. A Note About Children</h2>
<p>We do not intentionally gather Personal Data from visitors who are under the age of 13. If a child under 13 submits Personal Data to Group and we learn that the Personal Data is the information of a child under 13, we will attempt to delete the information as soon as possible.

<h2>4. A Note to Users Outside of the United States</h2>
<p>If you are a non U.S. user of the Site, by visiting the Site and providing us with data, you acknowledge and agree that your Personal Data may be processed for the purposes identified in the Privacy Policy. In addition, your Personal Data may be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the United States, where laws regarding processing of Personal Data may be less stringent than the laws in your country. By providing your data, you consent to such transfer.</p>
<h2>5. Types of Data We Collect</h2>
<p><strong>“Personal Data”</strong> means data that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, IP address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as any other non-public information, including financial information, about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data. “Anonymous Data” means data that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Data; Anonymous Data does not, by itself, permit the identification of individual persons. We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data, as described below.</p>
<p><strong>(a) Information You Provide to Us.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We may collect Personal Data from you, such as your first and last name, e-mail and mailing addresses, professional title, Group name, phone number, and password when you create an account to log in to our network (<strong>“Account”</strong>).</li>
<li>If you use our Services on your mobile device, including through our Application(s), we may collect your phone’s unique device ID number.</li>
<li>If you tell us where you are (e.g., by allowing your mobile device to send us your location), we may store and use that information to provide you with location-based information.</li>
<li>Certain Services may require our collection of your phone number. We may associate that phone number to your mobile device identification information.</li>
<li>We retain information on your behalf, such as files and messages that you store using your Account.</li>
<li>If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply.
When you post Content, including financial information and documents relating to you, on our Site, the information contained in your posting will be stored in our servers and other users who you have designated and invited to use the Services will be able to see such content, depending on the permissions determined by us.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(b) Information Collected via Technology.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Information Collected by Our Servers.</strong> To make our Services more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect information from you, including your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit.</li>
<li><strong>Log Files.</strong> As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (“ISP”), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users’ movements around the Site, gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, and better tailor our Services to our users’ needs. For example, some of the information may be collected so that when you visit the Site or the Services again, it will recognize you and the information could then be used to serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your interests. Except as noted in this Privacy Policy, we do not link this automatically-collected data to Personal Data.</li>
<li><strong>Cookies.</strong> Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information. “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing the website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site. This type of information is collected to make the Site more useful to you and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests and needs.</li>
<li><strong>How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals.</strong> We attempt to respond to such signals or other mechanisms that might enable Users to opt out of tracking on our site, but make no guarantee that they will indeed work.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile Services.</strong> We may also collect non-personal information from your mobile device if you access our Services through a mobile phone. This information is generally used to help us deliver the most relevant information to you. Examples of information that may be collected and used include your geographic location and information about the type of device you use.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(c) Information Collected from Third Party Companies.</strong>
We may receive Personal and/or Anonymous Data about you from companies that provide our Services by way of a co-branded or private-labeled website or companies that offer their products and/or services on our Site. These third party companies may supply us with Personal Data. We may add this information to the information we have already collected from you via our Site in order to improve the Services we provide.</p>
<h2>6. Use of Your Personal Data</h2>
<p><strong>(a) General Use.</strong> In general, Personal Data you submit to us is used either to respond to requests that you make, or to aid us in serving you better. We use your Personal Data in the following ways:</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>(b) Creation of Anonymous Data.</strong> We may create Anonymous Data records from Personal Data by excluding information (such as your name) that makes the data personally identifiable to you. We use this Anonymous Data to analyze request and usage patterns so that we may enhance the content of our Services and improve Site navigation. We reserve the right to use Anonymous Data for any purpose and disclose Anonymous Data to third parties in our sole discretion.</p>
<h2>7. Disclosure of Your Personal Data</h2>
<p>We disclose your Personal Data as described below and as described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.</p>

Such third parties will have limited access to your Personal Data and Anonymous Data, based on permissions set by us, which are based on a need to know. Depending on the type of access granted to such third parties, they may also be permitted to edit the information you have provided to us. You may change your settings at any time as to who has access to your information by going to your account settings and changing your publishing options.</p>
<p><strong>(b) Third Party Service Providers.</strong> We may share your Personal Data with third party service providers to:  provide you with the Services that we offer you through our Site; to conduct quality assurance testing; to facilitate creation of accounts; to provide technical support; and/or to provide other services to the Group. These third party service providers are required not to use your Personal Data other than to provide the services requested by our Group.</p>
<p><strong>(c) Corporate Restructuring.</strong> We may share some or all of your Personal Data in connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition or dissolution transaction or proceeding involving sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion of our business or assets.

<h2>8. Third Party Websites</h2>
<p>Our Site may contain links to third party websites. When you click on a link to any other website or location, you will leave our Site and go to another site, and another entity may collect Personal Data or Anonymous Data from you.
