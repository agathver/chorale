## Iconography

+ We use [Material Design Icons](https://www.materialdesignicons.com) in their SVG form.

## Established rules

+ Use [“smart quotes”](https://smartquotesforsmartpeople.com/) at all times.
+ Base language is American English with the Oxford comma.
+ Use square buttons with rounded corners at 0.25rem.
+ Sizing units are in `rem` (web standard).
+ You can calculate `rem` to `px` by multiplying any given `rem` unit by 16. Example: 2.5rem * 16 = 400px
+ Most importantly, stay consistent!
